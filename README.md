## How to Install (for Chrome)

1. Download the browser extension's zip file by clicking [here](https://github.com/imtixz/stop-downloading-the-pdf/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Extract the zip file to any location.
3. Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
4. Turn on **Developer mode** (top right corner).
5. Click **Load unpacked**.
6. Select the folder you extracted in step 2 (the one with `manifest.json` inside).
7. Done! Now visit your BRACU dashboard and you'll find that the download button has turned into a view PDF button.

If you want to remove the extension later on, just delete it from the Chrome extensions page.

## How to Install (for Firefox) 

> **Note:** Installing the extension in Firefox using the method below is not recommended, as it is very inconvenient. The extension will be removed every time you close Firefox, so you'll need to repeat step (3-5) each time you open firefox.

1. Download the browser extension's zip file by clicking [here](https://github.com/imtixz/stop-downloading-the-pdf/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Extract the zip file to any location.
3. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
4. Click **Load Temporary Add-on...**
5. Select the `manifest.json` file from the folder you extracted in step 2.
6. Done! Now visit your BRACU dashboard and you'll find that the download button has turned into a view PDF button.
