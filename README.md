# Stop Downloading THE PDF

A browser extension that opens your BRACU grade-sheet PDF directly in the browser instead of downloading it.

## How to Install (for Chrome)

1. Download the browser extension's zip file by clicking [here](https://github.com/imtixz/stop-downloading-the-pdf/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Extract the zip file to any location.
3. Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
4. Turn on **Developer mode** (top right corner).
5. Click **Load unpacked**.
6. Select the folder you extracted in step 2 (the one with `manifest.json` inside).
7. Done! Now visit your BRACU dashboard and you'll find that the download button has turned into a view PDF button

If you want to remove the extension later on, just delete it from the Chrome extensions page.
